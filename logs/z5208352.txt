Week 2

We decided on our project this week. We also began background research as to what API's we wanted to use. Also looked at existing portfolio management systems in order to get an idea of how we wanted to setup our website.

Week 3

This week we completed the proposal. This was relatively straightforward. I also broke down the components of the epic story of the user profile into separate stories. We also decided on which API's we are going to use.

Week 4

Created the login service. Users can signup and consequently login to the system. At this stage user data is stored in a csv file which is read each time we validate a user's login.

Week 5

Adjusted the login service so that it uses the database. Now when a user is created they are placed into the 'users' table. Using databases for the first time was an obstacle I faced. Using advice from other members of the team I was able to implement this with minimal difficulty. When using the application, users can signup and login to the system to begin using the functionality.

Week 6

Began using the flask login module in order to validate users. This means we could use @login_required to ensure users cannot bypass the login system. The main obstacle was deciding how to store user information and parse this to the login module, as we stored user data in the database rather than a detailed user object. I decided to create a user object that contains the user's email as the unique identifier that can be used to access the database.
